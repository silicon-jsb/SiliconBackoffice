# Assignment Backoffice System with Blazor
For this assignment, we are developing a backoffice system for a previously built website, based on the Silicon design template. We chose Blazor as our platform instead of Next.js, aligning with our .NET development focus and industry demand.

Project Scope
Microservices Architecture: The system is divided into independent subsystems communicating via REST, gRPC, or messaging queues.
Backoffice Features:
Customer management
User management with roles (admin)
Course management
Order tracking
Real-time chat using WebSockets
Frontend Enhancements: Expanding the user account pages with additional functionality based on the new design template.
Deployment: Applications and subsystems will be hosted on Microsoft Azure with proper resource planning to optimize costs.
Technologies: Blazor, GraphQL, Microsoft Azure, WebSockets
By following SOLID principles and best practices, we aim to build a scalable and maintainable system while ensuring a professional backoffice experience.
